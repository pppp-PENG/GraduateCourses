It increases dopaminergic activity and may have potential interactions with SSRIs, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome.\n  - B. 普拉克索 (Pramipexole): A dopamine agonist, effective in treating Parkinson's symptoms. Generally well-tolerated and often used as an initial treatment in older patients to delay the use of L-DOPA.\n  - C. ⾦刚烷胺 (Amantadine): Can be used to treat dyskinesia in Parkinson's patients and has some modest efficacy on symptoms. However, not typically a first-line choice for initial therapy, especially in elder patients due to potential cognitive side effects.\n  - D. 吡贝地尔 (Piribedil): Another dopamine agonist used for symptomatic relief in Parkinson's disease. It has a similar function to pramipexole.\n  - E. 恩他卡朋 (Entacapone): A COMT inhibitor, used to enhance the effect of L-DOPA. It is not used as monotherapy and only helpful when introduced with L-DOPA.\n\n**Step 4: Cross-verification**\n- Analyzing clinical guidelines and pharmacological profiles for Parkinson's disease and drug-drug interactions with SSRIs, dopamine agonists like Pramipexole (B) and sometimes Piribedil (D) are recommended for better safety profiles and effectiveness in elderly patients without needing to co-administer with L-DOPA initially.\n- Selegiline poses a risk when combined with SSRIs due to serotonin syndrome.\n\n**Step 5: Final Confirmation**\n- Based on the analysis, the drugs that best fit an elderly patient with the newly diagnosed Parkinson's who is on an SSRI (sertraline) are Pramipexole (B) and potentially Piribedil (D), considering Selegiline (A) can have interactions.\n\nCorrect answer: B, D", "question_type": "多项选择题", "groundtruth": "BCDE"}

Cmax (Maximum concentration): Refers to the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration. It does not describe fluctuation, but rather the peak level.\n  - B. DE (Drug Excretion): Not a standard term directly related to fluctuation.\n  - C. MRT (Mean Residence Time): Describes the average time a drug molecule stays in the body but doesn't directly reflect fluctuation.\n  - D.

AUC (Area Under the Curve): Represents the total drug exposure over time but not directly the fluctuation.\n\nFor the fluctuation of a drug in the body, none of the standard pharmacokinetic parameters typically used for this purpose are directly listed here. However, a related concept often involves consideration of the difference between Cmax and Cmin (trough concentration), which relates more to fluctuation (termed as \"peak-to-trough fluctuation\" or \"swing\"), but without these values explicitly listed, we need to reevaluate the available answers. Sometimes AUC is indirectly related to understanding such fluctuations over a dose interval when combined with Cmax and Cmin.\n\n**Step 4: Cross-verification**\n- Based on pharmacokinetic principles typically used for discussing fluctuation within doses, parameters like fluctuation percentage [(Cmax-Cmin)/Cmin] may be used, but not strictly as AUC alone.\n\n**Step 5: Final Confirmation**\n- The choice here seems unsettled by standard definitions for fluctuation. Since direct fluctuation metrics aren't options, and AUC is one of the most integral parts related to drug concentration-time profile understanding indirectly (even though it’s more about overall exposure instead of momenta fluctuation here), typical pharmacy questions may expect a more thorough knowledge around the key pharmacokinetic relationships. A more concise understanding or knowledge of how these terms breakdown can vary from tests and academic framing, sometimes MST (Mean Stay Time) or similar variance reflecting terms are not part of this basic list is a stronger match.

Pregnancy risk categories are classifications assigned to medications based on their potential effects on a developing fetus.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously used a system of five pregnancy categories—A, B, C, D, and X—to classify the potential risks of drugs. This system has been replaced with new labeling rules, but it was in place for many years, and these categories are still often referenced.\n\n- Category A: Adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters).\n- Category B: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.\n- Category C: Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.\n- Category D: There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.\n- Category X: Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data, and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.\n\nAmlodipine is generally classified as Category C.\n\n**Step 4: Cross-verification**\n\nRe-confirming from standard references such as the latest drug prescribing information and pharmacological resources, amlodipine remains classified as Category C for pregnancy, indicating that it should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus.\n\n**Step 5: Final Confirmation**\n\nThe correct answer matches the analysis and aligns with standard classification references.

Most lipophilic (fat-soluble) small molecule drugs are absorbed through the biological membranes by passive mechanisms.\n- Among the given options:\n  - **A. 膜孔滤过 (Membrane pore filtration):** This is generally relevant for hydrophilic substances, not lipophilic.\n  - **B. 简单扩散 (Simple diffusion):** Lipophilic drugs can easily diffuse across cell membranes without the need for transporter proteins due to their solubility in the lipid bilayer.\n  - **C. 膜动转运 (Membrane transport):** This implies a form of active transport or movement which is not required for passive diffusion.\n  - **D. 易化扩散 (Facilitated diffusion):** This applies to substances that need a carrier protein, typically relevant for ions and polar molecules.\n  - **E. 主动转运 (Active transport):** Involves energy to move substances against their concentration gradient, usually not needed for lipophilic molecules.\n\n**Step 4: Cross-verification**\n- Based on the pharmacological principle that lipophilic molecules pass through membranes by simple diffusion due to their solubility in the lipid bilayer, Option B is confirmed.\n\n**Step 5: Final Confirmation**\n- The correct answer, aligning with the pharmacological principles regarding the absorption mechanism of lipophilic drugs, is:\n  \nCorrect answer: B", "question_type": "配伍选择题", "groundtruth": "B"}

Therefore, focus should be on pharmacology related to gout treatment, particularly drugs that can work synergistically with febuxostat.\n- Febuxostat is used to lower uric acid levels in gout patients. Common strategies to enhance uric acid-lowering therapy include the use of uricosuric agents or medications that can alter urinary pH to promote uric acid excretion.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\nA. 阿托伐他汀 (Atorvastatin) - Primarily used for lowering cholesterol, not directly related to uric acid.\nB. 甲巯咪唑 (Methimazole) - Used for hyperthyroidism, unrelated to uric acid control.\nC. 丙硫氧嘧啶 (Propylthiouracil) - Also used for hyperthyroidism, not relevant to uric acid management.\nD. 氢氯噻嗪 (Hydrochlorothiazide) - A diuretic that can actually increase uric acid levels, potentially worsening gout.\nE. 碳酸氢钠 (Sodium bicarbonate) - Can alkalinize the urine, which may help in excreting more uric acid and can be used adjunctively.\n\n**Step 4: Cross-verification**\n- Based on the pharmacological principles discussed, sodium bicarbonate is known to alter urine pH, facilitating uric acid excretion. This is synergistic with urate-lowering therapies like febuxostat.\n\n**Step 5: Final Confirmation**\n- Only Sodium Bicarbonate (E) aligns with the requirement of enhancing the uric acid-lowering effect without adverse implications on gout.\n\nCorrect answer: E", "question_type": "配伍选择题", "groundtruth": "E"}
